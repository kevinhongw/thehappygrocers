# The Happy Grocers

## Production Site

Please only interact with the "Playground" store as right now the Hong family is actively using this app as thier grocery shopping list.

This is a project for me to

1. learn NextJS
2. solve our family's complex grocery shopping list.

## Inspiration

Either my partner and I or the in-laws will go do the grocery shopping, and we constantly find ourselves repeating the same things to buy. The group chat often gets flooded with shopping items from family members.

Right now, this application is just a glorified to-do list app, but it's a good starting point.

## Tech Stack

- NextJS
- Next PWA
- Tailwindcss
- Daisy UI
